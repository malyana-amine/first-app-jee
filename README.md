# JEE App - README

## Overview
This README provides information about the "JEE App," a Java EE (Enterprise Edition) web application. The application is built using Java EE technologies and Hibernate for database connectivity. The provided `pom.xml` file is a Maven Project Object Model (POM) configuration for this application.

## Project Information
- **Group ID:** com.example
- **Artifact ID:** first_app_jee
- **Version:** 1.0-SNAPSHOT
- **Name:** First App JEE
- **Packaging:** WAR (Web Application Archive)

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development environment:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Apache Maven
- A Java EE compatible application server (e.g., Apache Tomcat, WildFly, or Payara)

## Dependencies
The project depends on the following libraries and frameworks. These dependencies are defined in the `pom.xml` file.

- **Jakarta Servlet API:** This is the core API for building Java EE web applications.
- **Hibernate:** An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework used for database operations.
- **PostgreSQL JDBC Driver:** The PostgreSQL database driver for connecting to a PostgreSQL database.

## Building and Running the Application
To build and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

2. Clone or download the project source code.

3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following Maven command to build the application:

    ```
    mvn clean package
    ```

5. Deploy the generated WAR file to your Java EE compatible application server. The exact steps for deployment depend on the server you are using.

6. Access the application in a web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL, depending on your server and configuration.

## Additional Configuration
- If you intend to use a different database, update the Hibernate configuration accordingly in your application code.
- You can also add additional dependencies in the `pom.xml` file to suit your specific requirements.
